When making contributions to the spacebar code repository, please follow these standards as closely as possible.
- Use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to format all python code
- Use [Google Style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html) docstrings for code documentation
- Use [PEP484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) type hinting
- When making scripts for example purposes, create a Jupyter notebook in spacebar>examples to ensure compatibility with [curvenote](https://curvenote.com/)
- Organize classes and methods by purpose (example: adding non-singular orbital elements would be a class NonSingularElements in spacebar>astro>orbit>elements.py)
- Open issues to allow discussion of the appropriate structure when meaningful destinations do not exist
